# hello-word
Hello, everyone! 

My name is Gabriel and I am getting started with GitHub.

I am very fond of developing applications and this is an introduction for me to start taking the first step towards a Full Stack Developer career.

Currently, I am studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but, during college, I studied some programming languages such as C and Python. Now it is time to get professional!

I want to code for my living and I hope you all can see my name in the copyrighs of some awesome applications very soon!

Cheers!
